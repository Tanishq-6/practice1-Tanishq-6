Data Analysis

In the past month, the three activities I've been working on are
1.Analyzing the data collected over time in R studio for my class STAT 472
2.perform hypothesis testing and point estimation
3.Constructing plots (Boxplots,Density Plot, Contour plot) using ggplot in R

Tools and strategies for organising my work
1.Box to organize my files by class and type.I can create folders and subfolders, so I can keep related files together and easily find what I need.
2.I create separate projects for each class in RStudio to avoid confusion and organise my work.
3.To ensure my files are always up-to-date,I save them in your Box folder. This will allow Box to automatically sync changes across all devices.

Edit: I think that this is a good way to describe data science, and I this your study strategies are effective.
